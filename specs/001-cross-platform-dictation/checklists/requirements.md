# Specification Quality Checklist: Voice Dictation Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

**Validation Summary**:

- 3 user stories with clear priorities (P1: Hotkey Recording, P2: Streaming Transcription, P3: Cross-Platform)
- 25 functional requirements covering all core features (including multi-language support)
- 12 success criteria with specific, measurable metrics
- 9 edge cases identified (including language-related scenarios)
- 6 key entities defined (including Language Configuration)
- 7 assumptions documented
- No implementation details (frameworks, languages, or technical solutions)
- All requirements are technology-agnostic and focused on user outcomes
- Language selection follows constitution principle: simplest possible method (no UI required)
