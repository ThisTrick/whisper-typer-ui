# Specification Quality Checklist: CLI Tool Installation and Background Service Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- **Content Quality**: The specification successfully avoids implementation details, focusing on user value and behavior. All mandatory sections are complete and written for non-technical stakeholders.

- **Requirement Completeness**: All 23 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are present as the feature requirements are straightforward. Success criteria are all measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "Service starts in background within 3 seconds" rather than "Python daemon spawns process").

- **Feature Readiness**: User scenarios are prioritized (P1: Installation, P2: Service Management, P3: Auto-start) and independently implementable. Edge cases comprehensively cover failure scenarios. Dependencies are clearly stated in Assumptions section (uv installed, sufficient permissions, etc.).

- **Validation Result**: âœ… All checklist items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.
